# Missions-Expanded-VU
Current Mission Expanded VU files
Guide for manual installation :

If you're reading this you've already done the 1st step : download the .zip file

2/Once you've downloaded the .zip file extract in Europa Universalis 4 mod folder
If you're on windows here's the path : ~\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod\
If you're on Linux here's the path : ~/.local/share/Paradox Interactive/Europa Universalis IV/mod/
If you're on Mac here's the path : ~/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Europa Universalis IV/mod/

3/Once you've extracted the mod folder copy, copy the Missions-Expanded-VU-1.35.mod that you'll find inside the Mission Expanded folder you've just extracted to your mod folder.
4/Open the .mod with a text editor (Notepad will do) file and make sure the path="mod/..." has the same name than your mod folder (eg : if you've named your mod folder "ME-VU 1.35" you should have path="mod/ME-VU 1.35")
5/Launch the game

PS : Sometimes the launcher will not find your mod. In that case your path to path="C:\Users\<Username>\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod\<mod folder name>"
